My problem is that after i got my first job i slowed down on my personal learning and 
most of the skills i got from projects i was in . 
So now i want to continue my learning and i did found my pretty old project 
on wich i wanted to improve my symfony skill, as well as frontend skill

So the idea of the project is folowwing - i getting info about diffrent cryptocurrencies ,
listing them on page - there will be diffrent search options, diffrent filters etc.

And i will have the ability to add some of crypto to favorite section. 
So in this section i will get live price of selected crypto.

Mostly i warked on 

1. I have hardcoded dependencies, but obviosly i want to use dependency injections
2. For the frontend part for now i have twig template engine, but now i am thinking to  use react or angular for injections
Maybe it not really nessesery for small project like this 
3. I want to use some patterns in this project becorse for now it's not clear area
